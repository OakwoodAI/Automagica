# Automagica Client
Automagica is an open source Smart Robotic Process Automation (SRPA) platform. With Automagica, automating cross-platform processes becomes a breeze. With this open source library we want to provide a comprehensive and consistent wrapper around known and lesser known automation libraries  .

Refer to our [website](https://www.automagica.be) for more information, registered users can acces the [portal](https://portal.automagica.be). For more info see the [documentation](https://automagica.readthedocs.io).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.6.5 from https://www.python.org

### Installation instructions
Install Automagica on the bot host machine:
```
pip install https://github.com/OakwoodAI/automagica/tarball/master
```

### Importing the activities

Before getting started, don't forget to import the activities from automagica in your python script. If unsure, it is possible to import all the activites for development purposes by starting your script with:
```
from automagica import *
```

#### Optional (to enable Optical Character Recognition)
For _Windows_, install Tesseract 4 [from here](http://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-setup-4.00.00dev.exe).

For _Linux_ (Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```
For _MacOS_:
```
brw install tesseract
```

### Failsafe

As a safety feature, a failsafe mechanism is enabled by default. You can trigger this by moving your mouse to the upper left corner of the screen. You can disable this by running the following command in the editor:
```
Failsafe(False)
```
## Examples

Browser working with Excel:

SAP Automation (Production example, sensitive information is blurred):

## Running the examples
Running the examples is easy:
```
cd examples
dir
cd <example-name>
automagica -f app.py
```


### Example code

This is a simple example that opens Notepad and types 'Hello world!'.

```
PressHotkey('win','r')
Wait(seconds=1)
Type(text='notepad', interval_seconds=0)
PressHotkey('enter')
Wait(seconds=2)
Type(text='Hello world!', interval_seconds=0.15)
```

This is a simple example that opens Chrome and goes to Google.com.

```
browser = ChromeBrowser()
browser.get('https://google.com')
```

For more info and examples see the [documentation](https://automagica.readthedocs.io).

## Automagica with Natural Language

Wouldn't it be cool if we could write Robotic Process Automation scripts in plain ol' English rather than the already easy Python scripting language? Well it's possible with Automagica! We have cooked up a more human-friendly interface to get started with automation!

### How it works
Natural language for Automagica (.nla) looks like this:
```
open the browser
navigate to google.com
search for oranges
```

### Try it yourself

A Wit.ai key is included, so you can get a headstart! 

Install (in addition to the above) the following required package:
```
pip install https://github.com/OakwoodAI/understanding/tarball/master
```
Then install Natural Language for Automagica:
```
git clone https://github.com/OakwoodAI/natural-language-automagica
cd natural-language-automagica
pip install .
```

Then you can get started by running the examples:
```
cd examples
nla google.nla
nla wikipedia.nla
nla youtube.nla
```

We are quickly expanding the Natural Language Understanding features of this part of Automagica to make automation accessible to all!

## Important notes
For the `Type`-function to work, you need to set the "United States-International" keyboard layout on your system. If the keyboard layout is not available, outcomes of the function might be different.

## Credits
Under the hood, Automagica is built on some of the greatest open source libraries. Within Automagica, the following libraries are currently included:
